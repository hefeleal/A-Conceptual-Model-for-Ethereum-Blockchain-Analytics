## Testing

Unit test are critical to the OpenZeppelin framework. They help ensure code quality and mitigate against security vulnerabilities. The directory structure within the `/tests` directory corresponds to the `/contracts` directory. OpenZeppelin uses Mocha’s JavaScript testing framework and Chai’s assertion library. To learn more about how to tests are structured, please reference OpenZeppelin’s Testing Guide.
